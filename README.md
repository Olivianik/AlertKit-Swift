# SPAlert

**Popup from Apple Music & Feedback in AppStore**. Contains `Done` & `Heart` presets. `Done` preset present with animation. I clone Apple's alerts as much as possible. You can find this alerts in AppStore after feedback, after added song to library in Apple Music. I am also add alert without icon, as simple message.

## Requirements

Swift 4.2 & **5.0**. Ready for use on iOS 10+

## Installation

### CocoaPods:

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate `SPAlert` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SPAlert'
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate `SPAlert` into your project manually. Put `Source/SPAlert` folder in your Xcode project. Make sure to enable `Copy items if needed` and `Create groups`.

## Quick Start

For best experience, I recommend call alerts by `SPAlert`. These functions are updated regularly and show as Apple way. I focus on presets: 

```swift
SPAlert.present(title: "Added to Library", preset: .done)
```

Currently there are few presets. If you want **to add a new preset**, create a [issue](https://github.com/IvanVorobei/SPAlert/issues) and describe how you see it. I will try to quickly add new presets.


If you want use custom image, use func:

```swift 
SPAlert.present(title: "Love", message: "We'll recommend more like this in For You", image: UIImage(named: "Heart")!)
```

For show simple text message, use:

```swift 
SPAlert.present(message: "Empty UITextField")
```

## Usage

Sometimes it may require deep customization. In this section, I will show you what you can do.

### Duration

To change the time that the `SPAlert` will be shown, use property `duration`:

```swift 
let alertView = SPAlertView(title: "Added to Library", message: nil, preset: SPAlertPreset.done)
alertView.duration = 3
alertView.present()
```

### Layout

Here you can change the sizes and spaces:

```swift
alertView.layout.topSpace = 18
alertView.layout.iconHeight = 25
```

For more properties see class.

### Dismiss by Tap

If you click on the alert, it will disappear ahead of time. This can be disabled:

```swift
alertView.dismissByTap = false
```

### Haptic

If you use presets, the vibro-response will be start automatically. For customize this, you need set property `haptic`:

```swift
alertView.haptic = .success
```

For disable haptic, set it to `.none`.

### Corner Radius

I use a corner radius like an Apple. If you need to change it, see the property `cornerRadius`: 

```swift
alertView.cornerRadius = 12
```

## Required Presets

I will add new types and presets as needed. I will add animation and custom layout to them for a better experience. To know what presets need to be done, please inform me. You do not need to be shy. Make a new [issue](https://github.com/IvanVorobei/SPAlert/issues) and describe what kind of graphics or animation you would like. I will try to quickly add new items.
